# twitter_data_wrangling
Data Wrangling project done to analyze tweet data from the We Rate Dogs twitter account.
For this project, I had to gather, assess and clean three datasets with tweet information from the twitter account @dog_rates, also known as We Rate Dogs.
The tweet data was from the period of 2015-11-15 to 2017-08-01.
The project was done as part of the Udacity nanodegree program.
